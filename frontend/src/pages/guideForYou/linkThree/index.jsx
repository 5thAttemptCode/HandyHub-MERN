      Painting is one of the easier tasks that a first-time homeowner can take on. It doesn't require professional trade skills like electrical or plumbing work, nor does it require specialized tools. However, that doesn’t mean your first brush stroke will equal that of a professional painter. Read along and we’ll show you how to tackle any paint job around the home.

How to Prep a Room Before Painting
There’s a lot of work that should be done before you ever get your paint brush wet. This includes prepping the room that you’ll be painting and prepping the walls themselves. Skipping the room prep is a surefire recipe for drips and splatters—and therefore a surefire recipe for ruined floors, baseboards, ceilings or furniture. Not to mention the work of getting them clean again! Skipping the wall prep can mean your new paint doesn’t adhere to the wall properly, or that imperfection will show through to mar your hard work.

How to Prep a Room Before Painting
Preparing a room before painting it is essential to make sure the paint stays where it belongs - on the wall.

Step #1: Protect Your Furniture

Remove all furniture from the room or move everything to the center and cover with drop cloths. Also spread drop cloths over the floor.

What the Experts Say...
Geoff Sharp
“This tip seems very straightforward but is often times overlooked by first-time homeowners. Make sure to remove the furniture from the room that is going to be painted. Large pieces of furniture can be left covered in the center of a bigger room but if you are repairing drywall, everything should be removed. There is nothing better than having a beautiful new wall painted that adds vibrancy to your home. Nothing is worse though than having a few paint drops on a piece of furniture. Clear the decks folks!” Click to Tweet

Step #2: Remove Outlet Covers

Remove the plates covering your outlets and switches. Tape the screws to them so you don’t lose them. If you’re painting your ceiling, unscrew the cover plates of any light fixtures and allow them to slide down, then wrap the light fixture in plastic. If you have a fan in the room, you can remove the blades to make covering the fixture easier.

Step #3: Break Out the Painter’s Tape

Use painter’s tape to cover any exposed switches. Also apply tape around door handles, along baseboards and molding, around windows and any other room feature that you’ll be painting around.

Step #4: Scrape and Spackle

If there is peeling or flaking paint on the wall, use a putty knife to scrape it off. If there are any holes in the wall, use spackle (or a patching kit for large holes) to fix them. Apply primer to any repaired area.

Step #5: Dust and Apply Primer

Dust the walls you intend to paint and scrub them down with a damp rag or sponge.

Apply primer to the walls if:

You’re painting over bare drywall.
You’re painting over bare wood.
You’re using high-gloss paint.
You’re painting over walls that have been stained or damaged.
You’re making a drastic color change (for example from a dark color to a pastel).
Once the primer is dried, you can start painting your wall.

Important Note: 

If the walls you intend to paint are already painted, you may need to determine whether it was painted with latex or oil-based paint. The reason? You can’t paint over an oil-based paint with latex. So if your intended new color is latex-based and your current paint job is oil based, you’ll need to sand the wall and apply bonding primer before you can add the new coat.

To test your current paint simply dip a cotton swab or cotton ball in rubbing alcohol and rub it over a section of paint. If the paint comes off, it’s latex. If it doesn’t, it’s oil-based.

"A great tip for new DIYers spackling for the first time is using DAP’s Dry Dex Spackle paste. It goes on pink and dries white so you know when it’s ready and is thicker than regular spackle so it needs less coats." Click to Tweet

How to Choose the Right Paint Finish
If you think paint is paint, think again. Different paint types work best in different environments in order to achieve different results. Using the wrong paint type for the particular room you want to update or the effect you want to achieve can mean a lot of disappointment with the finished product, not to mention a lot of wasted effort.

To make sure you’re using the right paint for the job, use this list to choose the paint that best matches your project and style:

Flat or Matte Finish

Flat or matte paints have no shine and work very well to mask any problem areas on a wall. They’re best for ceilings and walls with a large number of imperfections. They also work well in bedrooms and areas of the house that don’t see constant use. Flat/matte paints are difficult to clean, so they should NOT be used in kitchens, bathrooms, or any other areas where splashes, spills, and dirt are frequent problems.

Satin Finish

Satin paints have a pearl-like sheen and a silky feel. They’re a good choice for painting over woodwork. Satin paints are also easy to clean, so they’re ideal for kitchens, bathrooms, children’s rooms and any areas where messes are frequent.

Eggshell Finish

Eggshell paints have a slight sheen. They work best in low-traffic areas, like bedrooms.  They should NOT be used in high-traffic areas like kitchens or hallways because their finish can easily wear away when brushed against frequently.

Gloss Finish

Gloss paints have a crisp, shiny quality. They are ideal for woodwork (like window frames) trim and moldings. Gloss paints generally shouldn’t be used on walls at all, because their high shine causes even slight imperfections to stand out. Gloss is the most durable type of paint and cleans easily.

Semi-Gloss Finish

Semi-gloss paints are durable like full gloss versions, but have less of a shine. Like gloss, they’re a good choice for woodwork, trim and moldings. They also work well in kitchens, bathrooms and other moist environments, because they stand up very well to humidity. Semi-gloss paints are also easier to clean.

Choosing the right paint finish.
Paint brush? Check. Semi-gloss finish for a burnished image of perfection? Check.
