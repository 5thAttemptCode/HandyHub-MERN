      How to Hang Something Heavy
So, you’ve finally decided to hang up those shelves you bought months ago and then left in your trunk. You’re all set to start enjoying your newly organized room as you place the last item on the last shelf—only for all your hard work to come crashing down. 

You can get away with hanging pictures willy-nilly, but anything heavier than that: ceremonial sabers, shelving, taxidermied animal heads and so on, needs to be nailed into a stud. Otherwise, the nail isn’t actually fixed to anything and won’t be able to support the object’s weight. You can always use an electronic stud finder, but if you don’t have one on hand and aren’t interested in purchasing one, here’s our low-tech stud-finding method:

Step #1: X Marks the Spot

Mark the general spot on the wall where you want to hang something. Starting at the end of the wall, use a measuring tape to mark 16 inches from the corner.

Step #2: Start Knocking Around

Now, knock on the wall at that spot. If you hear a solid (as opposed to a hollow) sound, you’ve found a stud!

Step #3: Keep Measuring 

Now all you need to do is continue measuring in 16 inch increments until you reach the stud closest to where you planned to hang your item.

Important Note: 

If you don’t hear a solid sound at your 16-inch mark, don’t despair. 16-inch spacing is currently the standard stud spacing, but if your home is older, the studs are likely spaced according to an older standard. Return to the end of the wall and make a mark at 12 and 24 inches from the corner. Knock on each of those spots. Wherever you hear the solid sound, complete the above process using that increment.

Step #4: Attach Your Anchor

Once you’ve found the stud closest to your X, you can nail/screw/bolt your hook or other anchor to the wall. This will ensure your antique cavalry saber mirror is securely fastened to the wall, rather than lying in a heap beneath it.

 

How to Hang Something Without a Stud:
Sometimes, there simply isn’t a stud where you need one. In that case, there are some heavy-duty fasteners you can use to hang something heavy directly onto your drywall:

Molly Bolts:

These bolts are designed to provide a permanent fastening point, and when we say permanent, we mean permanent. Molly bolts are built with teeth that dig into the drywall, as well as legs that attach themselves on the inside of the wall.

Molly bolts: the answer to most of life's problems. 

How to Install Molly Bolts:

1.    Drill a pilot hole into the wall corresponding the size of the bolt. 
2.    Insert the molly bolt and gently tap it into the wall. 
3.    Use a screwdriver to tighten the screw inside the bolt, raising the legs and securing the bolt in place. 
4.    You can hang items up to 50 lbs. in weight using a single molly bolt. 

 

Toggle Bolts:

Toggle bolts are so hardcore you can use them to install ceiling fixtures. Each bolt contains a pair of spring-loaded wings that dig into the inside of the wall, much like molly bolts, the difference being that toggle bolts are designed to hold more weight.

How to Install Toggle Bolts:

1.    Drill a pilot hole into the wall corresponding to the size of the bolt. 
2.    Insert the screw through the object you wish to hang and into your pilot hole. 
3.    Now screw the toggle partway onto the screw.  
4.    Push the toggle into the hole until you hear the wings expand. 
5.    Put pressure on the toggle as you tighten the screw. This will keep the wings from turning inside the wall. 
6.    Your toggle bolt is now ready to hold up pretty much anything.

How to Frame a Wall
Whether you simply want to partition off a portion of a room or are planning something a bit more ambitious, like building a walk-in closet, constructing non-load bearing walls is a relatively simple process. Essentially, you’re just building a square frame that you’ll line with studs and then cover with drywall. But the process can be a bit unfamiliar for a first-time homeowner going the DIY route.

Follow these steps below to learn how to frame a wall:

Framing a Wall Incorrectly
Older homes may have been built with different dimensions, but 16-inches on center is the current standard.

Step #1: Get the Spacing Right

It’s essential that wall studs be positioned “16 inches on center,” meaning that the center of each stud is spaced 16 inches away from the center of the next stud. It’s important to get this spacing right because drywall, cabinetry and other building materials are made to fit this framework.

Step #2: Build Your Header and Footer Plates

Cut two 2X4s to the length of the wall you intend to construct. These will be the header and footer plates you’ll nail your studs to. Lay out your plates, one above the other and stretch a tape measure across their full length.

Step #3: Mark Up Your Boards

Most tape measures have red markings indicating where studs should be placed when framing a wall. Wherever you see these marks, use a permanent marker to make an X 3/4 inches back from the mark, on both boards.

Step #4: Grab a Framing Square

Once you have marked the full length of each board, place the thin side of a framing square over the first X on both boards and draw a line across both boards on either side of the framing square. Repeat for all of your X’s. The thin side of a framing square is the same width as a stud, so when it comes time to nail in your studs, they will slot right into these lines, giving you a wall framed perfectly 16 inches on center.

Marking for Studs
This method is perfect for beginners. If you’re working with someone who’s framed walls before, they may frame differently.

How to Hang Drywall
On the surface, hanging drywall is a pretty straightforward task. The difficulty comes in deciding whether to hang your drywall sheets vertically or horizontally. Many DIYers choose to hang them vertically because it tends to be easier to handle the sheets this way. It also leaves a smaller gap between each sheet which tends to make plastering simpler and faster. While those may sound like great advantages, professionals agree that hanging drywall vertically will ultimately make your job harder and lower the quality of the finished product.

Aside from a few exceptions, you should hang drywall horizontally. Doing so greatly minimizes the number of seams you’ll need to plaster, which in turn minimizes the room for mistakes that will lead to a blemished wall.

Here’s how to hang drywall the right way:

Step #1: Measure & Trim

Measure to be sure that the end of each drywall sheet will fall on the middle of a stud. Trim wherever necessary.

Step #2: Cutout Space for Outlets & Fixtures

Measure the distance between studs and any electrical outlets or other elements that are part of the wall you’re covering. Transfer those measurements to the appropriate drywall sheet and use a keyhole saw to make cutouts to allow the drywall to fit over the item(s) in question.

Step #3: Attach the Drywall to the Studs

Apply adhesive (if desired) to the studs you’ll be fixing your first drywall sheet to. Have helpers apply the sheet to the studs. Use screws to affix the sheet to the studs on either end. Space screws 12-16 inches apart, and sink each screw just below the surface of the drywall.

Step #4: Break Out the Drywall Mud

When the wall is covered, apply drywall mud to the screw heads and the seams between sheets, using a mud knife. Drag you knife along the seams until they are completely filled.

Step #5: Finishing Touches

Before the mud is dry, apply drywall tape to the seams. Smooth the tape out with your mud knife, and then cover with more mud. Wait a day for everything to dry, and then repeat the entire mudding process. Your walls are now ready to be painted or wallpapered.
